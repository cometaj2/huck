You can execute:

  - pig (alias pig='pip install -e .')
    Executed in this folder, it installs the application as if it had been isntalled through pip
    and changes to the code are immediately reflected.

  - tag (alias tag='python setup.py tag')
    Tags the latest commit in the git repo to whatever __version__ is at.

  - pub (alias pub='python setup.py publish') - maintainer only
    This publishes the application to PyPI, the python package manager, and tags the latest commit
    in the git repo to whatever __version__ is at.

  - docker build -t hucker .
    Creates a centos docker image if you don't want to deal with python pip and other shell
    dependencies on your box. You'll need docker installed however.
    Once the image is created:
      - docker run --name hucker -dt hucker /bin/bash
    Then execute huckle commands on the standing container:
      - docker exec -it hucker huckle help
