.SH NAME
huckle \- A generic hypertext command line interface (HCLI) client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B huckle
[

.I <command>
.I <parameter>
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B huckle
is a generic CLI that can be used with any API that abides by
the standard version 1.0 hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.
.SH COMMANDS
.IP "pull <url>"
This attempts to auto configure a CLI via the root URL of an HCLI. If successful, the CLI
can be invoked by name, after restarting the terminal, as if created via "huckle create".
   
Note that an existing configuration file is left alone if the command is run multiple times
for the same CLI.
.IP "create <cliname>"
This allows you to crete an alias into a new HCLI API. Manual configuration of the root HCLI URL
is required under ~/.huckle/cliname/config and so is restarting the terminal (since we're using a ~/.bash_profile alias).
.IP "cli <cliname>"
Used to invoke a CLI. Note that the <cliname> alias created with
huckle create <cliname> should be used for brevity.
